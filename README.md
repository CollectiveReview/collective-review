Reviewing a scientific findings with collective intelligence.

## Abstract 
Accurately assessing the quality and significance of scientific papers is of utmost importance, yet the current review process proves unsustainable.

A startling 10% of reviewers handle half of all review requirements[]. The average number of refusals before securing a reviewer for a paper has increased by 46% between 2013 and 2017[]. In addition, 70.4% of researchers answers they rejects invitations because "the article is out of my area of expertise."ã€€As such, it has become increasingly challenging to find suitable reviewers for new papers.

The question, then, is how can we maintain a reliable assessment framework to distinguish between impactful, reliable papers and those of lesser importance?

In this paper, we propose the concept of 'push citation'. We begin by defining push citation, followed by an explanation of how it functions. Lastly, we explore potential drawbacks and unsuitable conditions for its implementation.
